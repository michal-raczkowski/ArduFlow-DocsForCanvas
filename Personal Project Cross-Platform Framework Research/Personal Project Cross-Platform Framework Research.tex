\section{Overview}
This research conducted a comparison of several frameworks, including Electron.js, Qt, Flutter, and NW.js, for developing the ArduFlow application. The evaluation focused on factors such as GUI customization options, resource utilization, UI rendering, cross-platform capabilities, and available libraries and tools. Electron.js emerged as a framework that allows developers to build cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies, providing extensive GUI customization and direct access to system resources. Qt offers a native look and feel with efficient resource utilization, while Flutter provides fast UI rendering and a single codebase for multiple platforms. NW.js combines web technologies with Node.js and system access. The selection of the most suitable framework depends on specific requirements such as GUI customization needs, performance considerations, development team expertise, and the availability of libraries and tools.

\section{Research}
This comparison examines various frameworks for developing the ArduFlow application. The evaluation aims to identify the most suitable framework for building the LED 8x8 matrix editor. Factors such as GUI customization, performance, platform compatibility, and available tools will be considered. The objective is to choose the optimal framework that aligns with the specific requirements of the ArduFlow project.

\subsection{Electron.js}
Electron.js is favored for its familiarity with web technologies, extensive GUI customization options, and direct access to system resources. However, it may have higher memory consumption and larger application size.

\subsection{Qt}
Qt stands out with its native look and feel, high performance, and efficient resource utilization. It offers extensive GUI customization options using QML. However, it has a steeper learning curve and limited availability of existing libraries.

\subsection{Flutter}
Flutter provides fast and visually appealing UI rendering, a customizable framework, and a single codebase for multiple platforms. However, it is relatively newer with a smaller community and limited availability of platform-specific libraries.

\subsection{NW.js}
NW.js combines web technologies with Node.js and offers access to a wide range of Node.js modules and native UI components. However, it may have higher memory consumption and larger application size.
